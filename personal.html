            The personal transportation has been a huge upgrade that <b>we have
            been seeing in the big cities</b>. Public bikes and scooters are all
            over the main cities as Grand Rapids and their accesibility is
            really easy, just with an app you can <b>rent</b> a scooter and leave it
            wherever you want when you are done.
            <br /><br />So we have think that whis types of transporation would
            be an incredible adition to Belding to help reducing the carbon
            footprint.

        <h2>
          How are we going to implement these ideas in Belding
        </h2>
        <h3>
          Implementing Bikes in Belding
        </h3>
        <p>
          Public bikes are the main transportation update the city will be able
          to implement. We took the price of <b>$200 each and we thought 50 bikes
          spread across 10 locations </b>would be an adequate amount.
          <br /><br />Belding has a small downtown area that is easy to navigate
          on a bicycle and also a highway that has much of the population and
          businesses on it, so bikes are an ideal mode of transportation.<br /><br />
          Each night we would pay <b>a person for collecting the bikes</b> and
          replacing them in their original racks for the beginning of the day.
          The bikes can be repaired and maintained at the bike shop in
          Greenville and any simple repairs can be done in house.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Implementing Scooters in Belding
        </h3>
        <p>
          As well as we are going to do with the bikes we are going to implement
          <b>around 50 scooters</b> all over the main areas in Belding. <br /><br />We
          are going to contact companies as <b>Lime</b> to give as the scooters and
          just with their mobile application they woould be able to rent the
          scooters and after that pay the amount of time that they have been
          riding the scooter.<br /><br />
          The average cost for a scooter is about<b> $300 and the maintenance is
          depending on the damage</b>, so it ranges is $50-$200.

          <p>
            One problem that we can face when implementing these personal
            transportation ideas is the fact that we don't have either bikes or
            scooters paths or trails. So in order to fix that problem we will
            need some money to paint bike paths on the roads or to make trails
            for bikes.<br /><br />
            But because of our idea is to use bikes and scooters as a
            tranportation method, we'd just need to paint paths on the roads
            which won't be really expensive.
