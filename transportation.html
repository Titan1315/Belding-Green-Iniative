          <p>
            Public tranpostation is the main method to reduce the carbon
            footprint in any city in the US.
            <b
              >Transportation is one of the main sources of C02 in the planet</b
            >
            and in order to reduce that we should have and use more public
            transportaion. <br /><br />
            Due to this we have come up with some ideas about implementing public
            buses, taxis and gondolas all over Belding so we can make Belding
            cleaner. But <b>implementing these ideas isn't cheap</b>, so we will
            have to either raise  money or the Belding mayor should
            start thinking about using more money to invest it into the public
            transportation.

            addition we thought about the idea of implementing <b>gondolas</b>,
            a modern type of transportation system that uses cable cars to move you to
            different parts of the city.

              <p>
                Implementing public buses might be the idea that requires the
                most money because
                <b>each bus would cost around $250 000 </b> with a maintenance cost of
                $35 000 a year, but if we include these types of transportation systems
                in the main areas and most of the houses in belding (so you
                just have to walk 5 minutes to each bus stop), we would reduce
                the carbon footprint greatly.

            Once we have decided the main ideas to improve the public 
            transportaiton systems and to reduce the
            carbon footprint we have to decide
            <b>where are we going to implement them,</b> because, in order to be
            effective we have to choose wisely, the areas we are going to
            implement the bus and taxi stops along with the gondola stations.<br /><br />
            There are many locations where we can add them but we have selected
            the ones that would be most effective because more people visit
            these places.

                    Wesco is the main gas station in Belding and most people go

                    The skatepark is a place
                    <b>where many teenagers hangout</b>, not only because of the
                    skatepark but because of the many things that are
                    sourrounding the area such as the soccer field, park and or the
                    museum.
