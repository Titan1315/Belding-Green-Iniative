          <p>
            Public tranpostation is the main method to reduce the carbon
            footprint in any city in the US.
            <b
              >Transportation is one of the main sources of C02 in the planet</b
            >
            and in order to reduce that we should have and use more public
            transportaion. <br /><br />
            Due to that we have come with some ideas abouot implementing public
            buses, taxis and gondolas all over Belding so we can make Belding
            cleaner. But <b>implementing these ideas isn't cheap</b>, so we will
            have to ether raise a lot of money or the Belding governor should
            start thinking about using more money to invest it into the public
            transportation.

            Our main ideas is to

            such as the high school, the Wesco gas station or the skatepark. In
            addition we thought about the idea of implementing <b>gondolas</b>,
            a modern type of transportation that uses cable car to move you to
            different parts of the city.

              <p>
                Implementing public buses might be the idea that requires the
                most money because
                <b>each bus would cost around $250 000 </b>with a maintenance of
                $35 000 a year, but if we include these type of transportation
                in the main areas and near most of the houses in belding (so you
                just have to walk 5 minutes to each bus stop), we would reduce
                the carbon footprint a lot.

            Once we have decided the main ideas that we are going to introduce
            in Belding to improve the public transportaiton and to reduce the
            carbon footprint we have to decide
            <b>where are we going to implement them,</b> because, in order to be
            effective we have to choose wisely the areas where we are going to
            implement the bus and taxi stops and the gondola stations.<br /><br />
            There are many locations where we can add them but we have selected
            the ones that would be more effective because more people visit
            those places.

                    Wesco is the main gas station in Belding and everyone goes
                    there at least once a day, so it would be a great idea to
                    add here bus and taxi stops and a gondola station,
                    <b>because it will be a center area in Belding</b> where
                    people would be able to move aorund easily. And after
                    arriving to Wesco using the bus they can use the personal

                    The skatepark area is a place
                    <b>where many teenagers hangout</b>, not only because of the
                    skatepark but because of the many things that are
                    sourrounding the area such as the soccer field or the
                    museum.
